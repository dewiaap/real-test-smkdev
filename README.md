What is the complexity of your code? Explain in detail the complexity of the second answer. Answer: To check if a string has balanced parentheses, I use the stack method. As I go through the string, I store each opening parenthesis in the stack. When I find a closing parenthesis, I ensure that it matches the top opening parenthesis in the stack. If there is a mismatched pair or if the stack was empty before, it indicates that the string is unbalanced. After finishing checking the string, if the stack still contains elements, it also indicates that the string is unbalanced.
